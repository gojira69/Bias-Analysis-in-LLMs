* Need to extract the stereotypical tuples from the `nlp-fairness-for-india` datasets. ----> `Done`

* Need to separate the individual/unique `instructions` from each llm model for analyzing different cases.  

* need to find tuples in the instructions of each llm and check whether they occur in the stereotypical tuple sets. 

# End Goal
* Your task is to analyze the prompts and true verdicts given and find patterns
    in the prompts and insights into how the prompts are distributed. Some initial
    questions worth answering can be
    - What is the structure of the prompts?
    - On what criteria are the prompts changing within the files?
    - What are the different actions, identity terms and genders used?
