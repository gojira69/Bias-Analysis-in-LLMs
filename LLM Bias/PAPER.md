# Research Paper Analysis

## Intro

- NLP has biases based on different metrics like religion, gender, region, etc.
- These biases are mostly determined in the western context. This is difficult for India, since it comprises of various communities and ethnicities.

## What does the paper talk about ?

- Overarching research agenda for NLP fairness in the Indian context accounting for societal, technological, and value aspects.
- Resources (curatedand created) for enabling fairness evaluations in the Indian context available
- Empirical demonstrations of prediction biases and over-prevalence of social stereotypes in data and models.

## What are the parameters/axes of disparities

- Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
- Gender
- Religion
- Region
- Caste

One can group 2 or more of these axes to determine the local manifestations (like `Region and Caste` which is specific to India). Axes like `region` and `caste` are more India specific.

### Region

- States compries of a specific `ethno-linguistic` group. Ex - Tamilians in Tamil Nadu, Bengalis in West Bengal, etc.
- Various institutions have some level of disparity among it's populi. Ex - crooked to Andhraites, cunning to Kannadigas, and brave to Punjab
- At a broader level, there is discrimination against `Tamilians, North-East Indians`, etc.

### Caste

- Caste based discrimination is still present.
- `Matrimonial sites` are a prominent example which match people based on caste.
- It is also very evudent in `politics`, where parties always try to gather the votes of the lower castes by promising `resevations`, etc.

### Gender

- Stereotype against women in Inda.
- Women in India are 58% less likely to connect to mobile Internet then men, have literacy rate of 65% compared to 85% for men, and 21% labor force participation compared to 76% for men.
- Differs a lot when compared to the `West`.

### Religion

- Differs a lot when compared to the West.
- `Christianity` (typically a majority religion in the West) is a minority religion (2.3% of the population) in India, along with `Sikhism` (1.9%), `Buddhism` (0.8%), and `Jainism` (0.4%).

### Ability

- People with `disability` are often abndoned or socially segregrated.
- Discrimination visible in jobs, workplace, etc.

### Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation

- Very difficult due to rise of positive attitude towards `LGBTQ+` community.
- Groups like the `hijra` community are still outcast.

## Identity terms focused by the paper

- Region: demonyms for states & union territories like Kashmiri, Andamanese.

- Caste: frequently used terms-10 Brahmin,Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, Dalit, SC/ST(Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes), OBC(Other Backward Classes).

- Religion: terms for populous religions- Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain.
